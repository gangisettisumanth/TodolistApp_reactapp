#TodoList Application 

Overview
Build a Todo application using React.js that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. The application fetches initial data from a remote API using Axios.

Features:-

#Display Existing Tasks:
Show a list of existing tasks, including the task name and its completion status (completed or not).
Initialize this list with todos fetched from the API.


#API Endpoint:
Utilize the following API endpoint to retrieve todos: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1/todos.

#Task Properties:
Each todo object from the API response has the following properties:
id (number): The unique identifier for the todo.
title (string): The title of the todo.
completed (boolean): Indicates whether the todo has been completed or not.

#Add New Tasks:
Provide an input field to add new tasks.
Validate before adding a task:
The task name should not be empty.

#Mark Tasks as Completed:
Allow users to mark a task as completed by clicking on it.
Visually distinguish completed tasks (e.g., by using a different color).

#Edit Task Name
Enable users to edit the task name by clicking on an edit button next to each task.
When a task is edited, update the task name in the list.

#Delete Tasks
Provide a delete button to allow users to remove a task from the list.
